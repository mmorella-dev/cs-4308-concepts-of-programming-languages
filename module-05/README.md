A half-arsed syntax tree generator for the SCL programming language.

Created as part of a project for CS 4308 Concepts of Programming Languages.

## Build

Requires that you have [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) installed, [Flex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex_(lexical_analyser_generator)), and [Bison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc)

Clone this repository, and execute `make`. This should generate the binary at `out/sclarse`.
